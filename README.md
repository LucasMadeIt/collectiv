# Collectiv

A simple, yet effective team voting app I built to make idea sharing a little more fun.  
You can create a team, invite others with a code, and vote on each other's ideas.

Try it here: https://lucasmadeit.github.io/collectiv/


## What it does

- Create a team and get a unique Team ID
- Share the code so others can join
- Add and vote on ideas
- View which ideas are most popular 

## Why I made it

I wanted to create a space where everyone on a team could easily share their opinions and vote on ideas — without needing fancy software or logins.  
I hadn’t seen anything quite like this before, so I figured I’d try building it myself. It’s a simple first version, and I’m still working on making the votes sync properly across users.
